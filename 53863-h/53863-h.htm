<h1>Mr. W. H. Power&rsquo;s Report to the Local Government
Board<br />
respecting a Special Mortality among Infants at Loughton,<br />
in the Epping Rural Sanitary District.</h1>
<p style="text-align: right"><span class="smcap">Edward C.
Seaton</span>, M.D.,<br />
<i>Medical Department</i>,<br />
<i>April</i> 15, 1878.</p>
<p>On the 22nd March 1878, complaint was made by Mr. Octavius
Deacon, of Golding&rsquo;s Hill, Loughton, to Mr. Secretary
Cross, that a serious attack by skin disease of his own infant
had resulted from the use for nursery purposes of violet powder,
which on analysis by Mr. G. Jones, F.C.S., had been found to
contain in large proportion white arsenic; and further, Mr.
Deacon stated his belief that a large and fatal prevalence of
skin disease among infants in Loughton had been due to the use in
a similar way of violet powder of a like sort.&nbsp; This
representation was referred by Mr. Cross to the Local Government
Board.&nbsp; On 25th March the Board received a communication
from the clerk to the Epping Rural Sanitary Authority enclosing a
statement by the Medical Officer of Health to the effect that a
special mortality among infants in his district, already reported
by him, had, he has now reason to believe, resulted from the use
of violet powder impregnated with arsenic.&nbsp; Hereupon the
present inquiry was ordered.</p>
<p>I lost no time in putting myself in communication with Mr.
Deacon and with the several officers of the Epping Rural Sanitary
Authority, and from them received every assistance in carrying
out my inquiry.&nbsp; Especially am I beholden to Mr. Fowler,
medical officer of health, who has supplied me with important
information respecting the occurrences resulting in the mortality
referred to; and to Mr. Bell, inspector of nuisances, who has
accompanied and assisted me day by day during my
investigations.&nbsp; To Mr. Lewis district medical officer, and
to other medical men practising in Loughton, my acknowledgments
are also due.</p>
<p>The result of this inquiry is as follows:&mdash;</p>
<p>Since early March 1877, 29 infants and children in Loughton
have been attacked by, and 13 have died of, a peculiar affection
of the skin, that had been regarded as an anomalous kind of
erysipelas.&nbsp; The disease was described to me by the mothers
or others nursing the cases as presenting the following
appearances:&mdash;</p>
<p>In fatal cases, a generally blackened condition of the skin of
the groins and pudenda, which quickly became somewhat swollen and
hard; this was frequently the first change observed.&nbsp;
Occasionally there was a like condition of the abdomen about and
below the umbilicus.&nbsp; The skin of the axill&aelig; and folds
of the neck was another part in which blackening and swelling was
commonly observed.&nbsp; Invasion of these several parts, when it
occurred, was simultaneous.&nbsp; In some instances vesication,
variously described as &ldquo;little white blisters,&rdquo;
&ldquo;yellowish bladders&rdquo; or &ldquo;bags of water&rdquo;
preceded or appeared about the same time as the blackness; in
others, blackness with, or without, vesication was preceded by a
short interval by a bluish red condition of the parts
affected.&nbsp; The vesicles breaking discharged clear fluid, and
left raw black surfaces, which did not, it would seem, take on
suppurative or sloughing action.&nbsp; In no instance was a tense
shining appearance of the skin spoken of; nor was there, except
in one case, any tendency of the blackened condition of the
surface to extend over the limbs or trunk.&nbsp; The
constitutional symptoms seem to have been great restlessness,
with fits of crying or screaming in the first instance, passing
soon into a condition apparently of collapse in which the infant
quietly died.&nbsp; The average duration of illness in these
cases was four to five days.</p>
<p>In non-fatal cases, the symptoms varied much in
severity.&nbsp; In almost all, blisters or bladders like those
already spoken of formed between the folds of the groins, in the
armpits, and in the neck.&nbsp; In some cases these vesications
broke and formed black excavated sores, in the neighbourhood of
which the skin became more or less indurated and
discoloured.&nbsp; From some of the sores &ldquo;cores came
out,&rdquo; and all discharged yellowish matter.&nbsp; In milder
cases minute vesicles burst and left shallow sores that were
little if at all discoloured, and that quickly healed under
appropriate treatment.&nbsp; The constitutional symptoms do not
seem to have been in any instance out of proportion to the local
malady.&nbsp; In few, if indeed in any, cases were vomiting or
purging prominent symptoms.</p>
<p><a name="page2"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 2</span>There has
now to be considered&mdash;What has been the nature of the
disease, and how did it come about?&nbsp; Has it been erysipelas
as it was at first thought to be; or, has it been, as recently
alleged, skin-poisoning?</p>
<p>I.&nbsp; <i>As to erysipelas</i>.&nbsp; From the above account
it appears by no means surprising that the malady in its graver
cases (many of the slighter ones did not come under medical
treatment) should have been regarded as a disease of the nature
of erysipelas.&nbsp; It resembled that disease in several
important features, and the constitutional symptoms, particularly
of the fatal cases, might well have belonged to erysipelas
itself.&nbsp; On the other hand it may be remarked that the
malady in question seems to have differed from erysipelas as
ordinarily observed in certain not unimportant particulars.&nbsp;
There was not, so far as I can ascertain, any of that marked,
tense, glistening or shining appearance of the skin, almost
invariably present in erysipelas of infants; moreover, the
affection had commonly no tendency to wander over the trunk and
limbs in the manner customary with such erysipelas; but instead
remained localised almost from the first, in each instance, in
the parts of the body primarily affected by it.&nbsp; This
appears to have been specially notable as regards those slighter
cases not medically treated; in such the vesication and
subsequent abrasion and induration of the skin was observed only
in the folds of the neck, armpits, and genital organs.&nbsp;
Nevertheless, before discarding the hypothesis of erysipelas, I
thought it well to inquire whether there had been any typical
erysipelas among infants or others in the parish; and whether the
facts of the distribution of the malady in question could be
explained on the supposition that those attacked had had conveyed
to them erysipelatous infection.&nbsp; In this sense inquiry has
result as follows:&mdash;</p>
<p>(1.)&nbsp; As to typical erysipelas.&nbsp; Except two cases,
occurring in adults, one in October the other in December 1877
(both it will be observed long after the earlier cases of the
infantile malady), I cannot hear of any occurrence whatever in
Loughton of ordinary erysipelas in persons of any age.&nbsp;
Vaccination proceeded as usual and no erysipelas or other disease
was observed in connexion with it.</p>
<p>(2.)&nbsp; As to likely channels for erysipelas propagation,
one kind only seems of importance as being in any degree
probable, viz., the baby linen clubs of the parish.&nbsp; These,
the church club and the chapel club, have been instituted for the
purpose of affording their subscribers body and baby linen during
the month subsequent to confinement.&nbsp; One rule common to
both clubs provides that clothing thus acquired shall be returned
properly cleansed and got up within five weeks from the date of
loan; and hence it might have happened that, assuming the disease
to have been erysipelas, babies&rsquo; napkins imbued with
specific contagion might have been returned to the club
imperfectly cleansed or not properly disinfected, and have thus,
on reissue, conveyed to other infants the infection of that
disease.&nbsp; Examination of the operations of these two clubs
shows that during the last 15 months there have been ten boxes or
bags of baby linen in circulation, and that of the 29 sufferers
by the malady 17 have received club linen, while 12 have
not.&nbsp; On the other hand 33 other infants have during the
same period had baby linen from one or other of the clubs without
ill result.&nbsp; The 17 sufferers, with 19 others, were all of
them members of the church club, the total operations of which
during the period referred to are shown in detail in Table I.</p>

</table>
<p>The facts to be learned from the above table are not upon the
whole suggestive of relation between the operations of the club
and the attack of sufferers by the malady, and for the following
reasons:&mdash;The four first sufferers, attacked almost
simultaneously in March 1877, received each of them a separate
box from the club, and in one instance only out of the four was
the next reissue of the box associated with attack of the infant
receiving it.&nbsp; Further, the interval between the issue of
the box and attack of the infant, in families invaded by the
disease, varied very oddly, and in a way too not easily
reconcilable with such incubation period as might have been
anticipated of erysipelas under circumstances of conveyed
infection.&nbsp; In 8, including the four first sufferers, it
varied from two to four or more weeks; in 7 it was nil or one day
only; while in two the infant was attacked before receipt of the
box.&nbsp; Examination of the same sort as regards the movements
of monthly nurses gave similarly negative evidence.&nbsp;
Apparently the disease, whatever may have been its origin, has
not been carried from case to case by means such as might have
conveyed erysipelatous or allied infection.</p>
<p>II.&nbsp; <i>As to skin-poisoning</i>.&nbsp; The malady from
which the 29 infants have suffered has now to be dealt with in
its relation to the particular violet powder that has been
alleged to have been the cause of it.&nbsp; This powder had, in
every instance that I myself investigated, been bought from one
or other of two grocer&rsquo;s shops situated, the one in the
High Road, the other at Baldwin&rsquo;s Hill, Loughton.&nbsp;
From inquiries by Mr. Bell, inspector of nuisances, it would
appear that of many shops in Loughton selling violet powder,
these two, and these only, obtained such powder from a certain
dealer in the East of London referred to by name by the medical
officer of health in his statement already mentioned.&nbsp; Mr.
Bell further ascertained that in Loughton this particular powder
was sold by the retail tradesmen in small penny packets or boxes
each of which bore the name and address of the wholesale dealer
in question.&nbsp; The facts of the connexion between the powder
thus sold in Loughton and the prevalence of disease are as
follows:&mdash;</p>
<p>1.&nbsp; Of the 29 sufferers, 27 had the particular powder in
use at or about the date of attack.&nbsp; Of the remaining two,
the mother of one had the particular powder in the house at the
time the infant was attacked, but did not, so far as she can
remember, use it; the other mother (whose infant suffered very
slightly) had no powder at all, and is of opinion that the
soreness of her infant&rsquo;s neck was the result of pressure
from the instruments used in delivery.</p>
<p><a name="page4"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 4</span>2.&nbsp;
The sufferers with few exceptions (all of whom however had the
powder) were grouped near to one or other of the two shops which
alone in this extensive parish sold the particular powder in
question.</p>
<p>3.&nbsp; Infants using the particular powder, and those alone,
were attacked by the malady.&nbsp; This is shown in the following
table, which is an abstract of the results of personal inquiry to
this end respecting infants born in the parish during the half
year ended March 1878.&nbsp; Except where otherwise stated,
violet powder of some sort was used to every child, and (with
certain exceptions to be considered in the text) only one kind of
powder was in use to the several children attacked by the
malady.</p>

<p>4.&nbsp; Further and detailed evidence confirmatory in a high
degree of relation in the sense of effect to cause between the
malady of infants and the use of the particular powder, could,
were it necessary, be given in regard of most, if not all, of the
cases attacked by the disease.&nbsp; But the following will
suffice.&nbsp; They are also explanatory of the interval between
birth and attack observed in certain cases recorded in the above
and in the previous table.</p>
<p>E. W., born 6th October 1877; attacked 25th October.&nbsp;
Mother states that for the first fortnight from birth she used
for dusting the infant violet powder purchased at a
distance.&nbsp; This being expended, she obtained a packet of the
particular powder from one of the two shops in the parish selling
it.&nbsp; A day or two after using this fresh powder she noticed
redness, blackness, and swelling of the privates and neck of the
infant; in three more days it died.&nbsp; C. N., born 7th
November 1877; attacked 31st December.&nbsp; Mother from
infant&rsquo;s birth used for dusting it violet powder from a <a
name="page5"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 5</span>chemist near at
home, and perhaps some also from a friend.&nbsp; On 29th December
she attended her daughter in confinement and took with her her
own infant.&nbsp; Here she used for both infants powder from one
of the two shops referred to.&nbsp; On 30th December her
daughter&rsquo;s, and on 31st December her own, infant was
attacked.&nbsp; Daughter&rsquo;s infant died January 1st; her own
recovered, but is much scarred.&nbsp; P. S., born 30th December;
attacked February 14.&nbsp; From birth until about February 11th
the mother used violet powder remaining in the house since her
last confinement; she also used starch.&nbsp; About the
last-mentioned date she obtained some of the particular powder,
and after using it perhaps three days noticed pimples on the
groins, under the scrotum, under the arms, and at both sides of
the neck.&nbsp; The pimples soon turned black, and became deep
holes discharging much yellow matter.&nbsp; Used the powder a few
days only; &ldquo;did not like it;&rdquo; &ldquo;it was
yellow;&rdquo; burned it.&nbsp; Child recovered.&nbsp; E. D.,
born 2nd January; attacked about 20th February.&nbsp; The mother
used starch powder from infant&rsquo;s birth until two days
before it fell ill, when, having no starch powder, she procured a
packet of the particular violet powder.&nbsp; This was used two
days only, but the infant suffered in the same way as P. S.&nbsp;
It recovered, but is scarred.&nbsp; H. J., born 19th February
1878; attacked middle March.&nbsp; The mother at and after
infant&rsquo;s birth used violet powder received as a present
from London.&nbsp; The day before the infant was attacked she
commenced using some of the particular powder recently
purchased.&nbsp; The groins only were affected in this case; they
became black and broke into sores.&nbsp; The use of the powder
was discontinued as soon as the infant fell ill.&nbsp; On one
occasion, however, it was used to a sister aged two years and
four months; she suffered in like manner.&nbsp; Both children
recovered.&nbsp; A. W., born 26th May 1877; attacked 9th
June.&nbsp; The mother states that until the infant was 11 days
old she had no powder at all.&nbsp; About 5th June she purchased
a packet of the particular powder and used it to the infant in
the ordinary way.&nbsp; On 9th June she noticed that the privates
were swelled, and that white bladders as big as a hazel nut had
formed thereon, as well as under the arms and around the
neck.&nbsp; These changed colour and broke into deep wounds which
discharged yellow matter.&nbsp; Cores came out from the sores
under the arms.&nbsp; The use of the powder was discontinued
after six days, and in about two months the infant was fairly
well.&nbsp; Hereupon the mother recommenced the use of the
particular powder, and the same night the infant was very
restless and screamed a great deal.&nbsp; Next morning &ldquo;the
bladders were out again;&rdquo; the powder was then burned.&nbsp;
The child eventually recovered, but is deeply scarred about the
scrotum, groins, neck, and armpits, as if by sloughing of the
soft parts hereabouts.&nbsp; F. W., born 20th February 1877;
attacked early in March.&nbsp; From birth the mother used violet
powder from a chemist near at hand, but when the infant was about
a fortnight old she bought, and used to the lower parts of its
body only, a packet of the particular powder.&nbsp; Next day the
infant broke out into sores about the navel and pudenda.&nbsp;
The use of the particular powder was at once discontinued and the
infant shortly got well.&nbsp; Some months later the mother being
out of violet powder, again used the particular powder to the
infant, and at once the sores reappeared.&nbsp; The powder was
then burned.&nbsp; A. D., aged three years, was attacked about
Christmas 1877 by varicella.&nbsp; During recovery and while the
pocks were dying away, she herself purchased a packet of the
particular powder, which was then used for dusting the eruption
about the pudenda.&nbsp; Almost at once the dying vesicles became
sores which turned black and discharged matter; on healing they
left scars.&nbsp; It is stated that in this instance the powder
was used on one occasion only.&nbsp; T. C., born 15th August
1877.&nbsp; 36 hours after birth pimples and bladders formed
about the privates and navel, which parts swelled, turned black,
and became hard; no sores.&nbsp; Infant died 21st August.&nbsp;
The particular powder was used in this instance from birth.&nbsp;
Three months afterwards some of the remainder of this powder was
used for dusting sores on the head, face, and arms of a sister
aged four years who had recently suffered from measles.&nbsp;
These sores became much worse and inflamed; those on the arms
have left large scars.</p>
<p>Incidentally it is here shown that those parts only of infants
bodies to which toilet powder is ordinarily applied have been
affected by the malady; and further that such application of the
particular powder has been constantly followed in very few days
by the symptoms complained of.&nbsp; Additional evidence
respecting the shortness of the interval between application of
the particular powder and the appearance of the symptoms
attributed to it, is afforded by the fact of 16 infants to whom
this powder was applied from birth onwards no less than 10 were
attacked in from one to four days.&nbsp; Nor is the conclusion,
irresistible from the foregoing evidence, in any way weakened by
the six instances in which the attack was not immediate; for
there must have been a beginning to the mischievous quality of
the powder bought at the shops of <a name="page6"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 6</span>the vendors of the particular
powder.&nbsp; These six cases were at the very commencement of
the total series.&nbsp; All of them, and they were of various
ages, from two to 20 weeks, fell ill at the same time, viz.,
early in March 1877.&nbsp; And though all of them it would appear
had used more than one packet of violet powder from one or other
of the two shops in question between birth and the commencement
of illness, in more than one instance a fresh packet of powder is
remembered to have been procured a day or two before
attack.&nbsp; So far from weakening, these exceptions strengthen
the conclusion; more than that, they seem to indicate that not
until the end of February or early March of last year did violet
powder bought at these two shops in Loughton possess hurtful
properties.</p>
<p>Probably enough has been made out to satisfy any reasonable
doubt that may have been entertained as to the connexion between
the use in Loughton of the particular violet powder and the
lamentable effects attributed to it.&nbsp; It will be observed
that the evidence is absolutely independent of the nature of the
irritating agent in the powder.&nbsp; Whether or not that agent
may have been arsenic, as found by Mr. Jones in the specimens
submitted to him by Mr. Deacon, matters nothing to the proof I
have given of this connexion.&nbsp; But I have submitted to Dr.
Dupr&eacute; for analysis samples of the violet powder which I
obtained from the mothers of three of the sufferers from the
malady, and when Dr. Dupr&eacute;&rsquo;s report is received I
shall append it.&nbsp; Meanwhile I annex a tabulated statement of
the cases investigated.</p>

class="smcap">Power</span>, April 4, 1878.</h2>
<p>All the powders were of a very pale yellowish colour, and
rather more gritty to the touch than ordinary violet powder; they
were also appreciably heavier, bulk for bulk.&nbsp; Taking the
weight of a given bulk of ordinary violet powder as 1, the same
bulk of these powders would weigh about 1.25.&nbsp; Under the
microscope they are shown to consist of potatoe starch mixed with
a very considerable proportion of crystalline matter, among which
regular octahedra (arsenious acid) can be distinguished.&nbsp; On
burning they evolve a very powerful arsenical odour.</p>

States without permission and without paying copyright
royalties. Special rules, set forth in the General Terms of Use part
of this license, apply to copying and distributing Project

specific permission. If you do not charge anything for copies of this
eBook, complying with the rules is very easy. You may use this eBook
for nearly any purpose such as creation of derivative works, reports,
performances and research. They may be modified and printed and given
away--you may do practically ANYTHING in the United States with eBooks
not protected by U.S. copyright law. Redistribution is subject to the
trademark license, especially commercial redistribution.

States. If an individual work is unprotected by copyright law in the
United States and you are located in the United States, we do not
claim a right to prevent you from copying, distributing, performing,
displaying or creating derivative works based on the work as long as
all references to Project Gutenberg are removed. Of course, we hope
that you will support the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting

agreement before downloading, copying, displaying, performing,
distributing or creating derivative works based on this work or any
other Project Gutenberg-tm work. The Foundation makes no
representations concerning the copyright status of any work in any
country outside the United States.

immediate access to, the full Project Gutenberg-tm License must appear
prominently whenever any copy of a Project Gutenberg-tm work (any work
on which the phrase "Project Gutenberg" appears, or with which the
phrase "Project Gutenberg" is associated) is accessed, displayed,
performed, viewed, copied or distributed:

  This eBook is for the use of anyone anywhere in the United States and
  most other parts of the world at no cost and with almost no

  are located before using this ebook.

1.E.2. If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is
derived from texts not protected by U.S. copyright law (does not
contain a notice indicating that it is posted with permission of the
copyright holder), the work can be copied and distributed to anyone in
the United States without paying any fees or charges. If you are
redistributing or providing access to a work with the phrase "Project
Gutenberg" associated with or appearing on the work, you must comply
either with the requirements of paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 or
obtain permission for the use of the work and the Project Gutenberg-tm
trademark as set forth in paragraphs 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.

1.E.3. If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is posted
with the permission of the copyright holder, your use and distribution
must comply with both paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 and any
additional terms imposed by the copyright holder. Additional terms
will be linked to the Project Gutenberg-tm License for all works
posted with the permission of the copyright holder found at the
beginning of this work.

License terms from this work, or any files containing a part of this
work or any other work associated with Project Gutenberg-tm.

electronic work, or any part of this electronic work, without
prominently displaying the sentence set forth in paragraph 1.E.1 with
active links or immediate access to the full terms of the Project
Gutenberg-tm License.

1.E.6. You may convert to and distribute this work in any binary,
compressed, marked up, nonproprietary or proprietary form, including
any word processing or hypertext form. However, if you provide access
to or distribute copies of a Project Gutenberg-tm work in a format
other than "Plain Vanilla ASCII" or other format used in the official
version posted on the official Project Gutenberg-tm web site
(www.gutenberg.org), you must, at no additional cost, fee or expense
to the user, provide a copy, a means of exporting a copy, or a means
of obtaining a copy upon request, of the work in its original "Plain
Vanilla ASCII" or other form. Any alternate format must include the
full Project Gutenberg-tm License as specified in paragraph 1.E.1.

1.E.7. Do not charge a fee for access to, viewing, displaying,
performing, copying or distributing any Project Gutenberg-tm works
unless you comply with paragraph 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.

access to or distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
provided that

* You pay a royalty fee of 20% of the gross profits you derive from
  the use of Project Gutenberg-tm works calculated using the method
  you already use to calculate your applicable taxes. The fee is owed
  to the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark, but he has
  agreed to donate royalties under this paragraph to the Project
  Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation. Royalty payments must be paid
  within 60 days following each date on which you prepare (or are
  legally required to prepare) your periodic tax returns. Royalty
  payments should be clearly marked as such and sent to the Project
  Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation at the address specified in
  Section 4, "Information about donations to the Project Gutenberg
  Literary Archive Foundation."

* You provide a full refund of any money paid by a user who notifies
  you in writing (or by e-mail) within 30 days of receipt that s/he
  does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg-tm
  License. You must require such a user to return or destroy all
  copies of the works possessed in a physical medium and discontinue
  all use of and all access to other copies of Project Gutenberg-tm
  works.

* You provide, in accordance with paragraph 1.F.3, a full refund of
  any money paid for a work or a replacement copy, if a defect in the
  electronic work is discovered and reported to you within 90 days of
  receipt of the work.

* You comply with all other terms of this agreement for free
  distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm works.

1.E.9. If you wish to charge a fee or distribute a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work or group of works on different terms than
are set forth in this agreement, you must obtain permission in writing
from both the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation and The
Project Gutenberg Trademark LLC, the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm
trademark. Contact the Foundation as set forth in Section 3 below.

1.F.

1.F.1. Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
works not protected by U.S. copyright law in creating the Project
Gutenberg-tm collection. Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may
contain "Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate
or corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other
intellectual property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or
other medium, a computer virus, or computer codes that damage or
cannot be read by your equipment.

1.F.2. LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees. YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH 1.F.3. YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.

1.F.3. LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from. If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium
with your written explanation. The person or entity that provided you
with the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in
lieu of a refund. If you received the work electronically, the person
or entity providing it to you may choose to give you a second
opportunity to receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund. If
the second copy is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing
without further opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4. Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS', WITH NO
OTHER WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT
LIMITED TO WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY OR FITNESS FOR ANY PURPOSE.

1.F.5. Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied
warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of
damages. If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement
violates the law of the state applicable to this agreement, the
agreement shall be interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or
limitation permitted by the applicable state law. The invalidity or
unenforceability of any provision of this agreement shall not void the
remaining provisions.

1.F.6. INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in
accordance with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the
production, promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works, harmless from all liability, costs and expenses,
including legal fees, that arise directly or indirectly from any of
the following which you do or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this
or any Project Gutenberg-tm work, (b) alteration, modification, or
additions or deletions to any Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any
Defect you cause.

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at
www.gutenberg.org

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular
state visit www.gutenberg.org/donate

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works.

Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg-tm concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search
facility: www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
