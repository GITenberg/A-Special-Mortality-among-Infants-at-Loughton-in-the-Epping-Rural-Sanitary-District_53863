          Mr. W. H. Power’s Report to the Local Government Board
        respecting a Special Mortality among Infants at Loughton,
                  in the Epping Rural Sanitary District.


                                                   EDWARD C. SEATON, M.D.,
                                                     _Medical Department_,
                                                         _April_ 15, 1878.

On the 22nd March 1878, complaint was made by Mr. Octavius Deacon, of
Golding’s Hill, Loughton, to Mr. Secretary Cross, that a serious attack
by skin disease of his own infant had resulted from the use for nursery
purposes of violet powder, which on analysis by Mr. G. Jones, F.C.S., had
been found to contain in large proportion white arsenic; and further, Mr.
Deacon stated his belief that a large and fatal prevalence of skin
disease among infants in Loughton had been due to the use in a similar
way of violet powder of a like sort.  This representation was referred by
Mr. Cross to the Local Government Board.  On 25th March the Board
received a communication from the clerk to the Epping Rural Sanitary
Authority enclosing a statement by the Medical Officer of Health to the
effect that a special mortality among infants in his district, already
reported by him, had, he has now reason to believe, resulted from the use
of violet powder impregnated with arsenic.  Hereupon the present inquiry
was ordered.

I lost no time in putting myself in communication with Mr. Deacon and
with the several officers of the Epping Rural Sanitary Authority, and
from them received every assistance in carrying out my inquiry.
Especially am I beholden to Mr. Fowler, medical officer of health, who
has supplied me with important information respecting the occurrences
resulting in the mortality referred to; and to Mr. Bell, inspector of
nuisances, who has accompanied and assisted me day by day during my
investigations.  To Mr. Lewis district medical officer, and to other
medical men practising in Loughton, my acknowledgments are also due.

The result of this inquiry is as follows:—

Since early March 1877, 29 infants and children in Loughton have been
attacked by, and 13 have died of, a peculiar affection of the skin, that
had been regarded as an anomalous kind of erysipelas.  The disease was
described to me by the mothers or others nursing the cases as presenting
the following appearances:—

In fatal cases, a generally blackened condition of the skin of the groins
and pudenda, which quickly became somewhat swollen and hard; this was
frequently the first change observed.  Occasionally there was a like
condition of the abdomen about and below the umbilicus.  The skin of the
axillæ and folds of the neck was another part in which blackening and
swelling was commonly observed.  Invasion of these several parts, when it
occurred, was simultaneous.  In some instances vesication, variously
described as “little white blisters,” “yellowish bladders” or “bags of
water” preceded or appeared about the same time as the blackness; in
others, blackness with, or without, vesication was preceded by a short
interval by a bluish red condition of the parts affected.  The vesicles
breaking discharged clear fluid, and left raw black surfaces, which did
not, it would seem, take on suppurative or sloughing action.  In no
instance was a tense shining appearance of the skin spoken of; nor was
there, except in one case, any tendency of the blackened condition of the
surface to extend over the limbs or trunk.  The constitutional symptoms
seem to have been great restlessness, with fits of crying or screaming in
the first instance, passing soon into a condition apparently of collapse
in which the infant quietly died.  The average duration of illness in
these cases was four to five days.

In non-fatal cases, the symptoms varied much in severity.  In almost all,
blisters or bladders like those already spoken of formed between the
folds of the groins, in the armpits, and in the neck.  In some cases
these vesications broke and formed black excavated sores, in the
neighbourhood of which the skin became more or less indurated and
discoloured.  From some of the sores “cores came out,” and all discharged
yellowish matter.  In milder cases minute vesicles burst and left shallow
sores that were little if at all discoloured, and that quickly healed
under appropriate treatment.  The constitutional symptoms do not seem to
have been in any instance out of proportion to the local malady.  In few,
if indeed in any, cases were vomiting or purging prominent symptoms.

There has now to be considered—What has been the nature of the disease,
and how did it come about?  Has it been erysipelas as it was at first
thought to be; or, has it been, as recently alleged, skin-poisoning?

I.  _As to erysipelas_.  From the above account it appears by no means
surprising that the malady in its graver cases (many of the slighter ones
did not come under medical treatment) should have been regarded as a
disease of the nature of erysipelas.  It resembled that disease in
several important features, and the constitutional symptoms, particularly
of the fatal cases, might well have belonged to erysipelas itself.  On
the other hand it may be remarked that the malady in question seems to
have differed from erysipelas as ordinarily observed in certain not
unimportant particulars.  There was not, so far as I can ascertain, any
of that marked, tense, glistening or shining appearance of the skin,
almost invariably present in erysipelas of infants; moreover, the
affection had commonly no tendency to wander over the trunk and limbs in
the manner customary with such erysipelas; but instead remained localised
almost from the first, in each instance, in the parts of the body
primarily affected by it.  This appears to have been specially notable as
regards those slighter cases not medically treated; in such the
vesication and subsequent abrasion and induration of the skin was
observed only in the folds of the neck, armpits, and genital organs.
Nevertheless, before discarding the hypothesis of erysipelas, I thought
it well to inquire whether there had been any typical erysipelas among
infants or others in the parish; and whether the facts of the
distribution of the malady in question could be explained on the
supposition that those attacked had had conveyed to them erysipelatous
infection.  In this sense inquiry has result as follows:—

(1.)  As to typical erysipelas.  Except two cases, occurring in adults,
one in October the other in December 1877 (both it will be observed long
after the earlier cases of the infantile malady), I cannot hear of any
occurrence whatever in Loughton of ordinary erysipelas in persons of any
age.  Vaccination proceeded as usual and no erysipelas or other disease
was observed in connexion with it.

(2.)  As to likely channels for erysipelas propagation, one kind only
seems of importance as being in any degree probable, viz., the baby linen
clubs of the parish.  These, the church club and the chapel club, have
been instituted for the purpose of affording their subscribers body and
baby linen during the month subsequent to confinement.  One rule common
to both clubs provides that clothing thus acquired shall be returned
properly cleansed and got up within five weeks from the date of loan; and
hence it might have happened that, assuming the disease to have been
erysipelas, babies’ napkins imbued with specific contagion might have
been returned to the club imperfectly cleansed or not properly
disinfected, and have thus, on reissue, conveyed to other infants the
infection of that disease.  Examination of the operations of these two
clubs shows that during the last 15 months there have been ten boxes or
bags of baby linen in circulation, and that of the 29 sufferers by the
malady 17 have received club linen, while 12 have not.  On the other hand
33 other infants have during the same period had baby linen from one or
other of the clubs without ill result.  The 17 sufferers, with 19 others,
were all of them members of the church club, the total operations of
which during the period referred to are shown in detail in Table I.

The facts to be learned from the above table are not upon the whole
suggestive of relation between the operations of the club and the attack
of sufferers by the malady, and for the following reasons:—The four first
sufferers, attacked almost simultaneously in March 1877, received each of
them a separate box from the club, and in one instance only out of the
four was the next reissue of the box associated with attack of the infant
receiving it.  Further, the interval between the issue of the box and
attack of the infant, in families invaded by the disease, varied very
oddly, and in a way too not easily reconcilable with such incubation
period as might have been anticipated of erysipelas under circumstances
of conveyed infection.  In 8, including the four first sufferers, it
varied from two to four or more weeks; in 7 it was nil or one day only;
while in two the infant was attacked before receipt of the box.
Examination of the same sort as regards the movements of monthly nurses
gave similarly negative evidence.  Apparently the disease, whatever may
have been its origin, has not been carried from case to case by means
such as might have conveyed erysipelatous or allied infection.

II.  _As to skin-poisoning_.  The malady from which the 29 infants have
suffered has now to be dealt with in its relation to the particular
violet powder that has been alleged to have been the cause of it.  This
powder had, in every instance that I myself investigated, been bought
from one or other of two grocer’s shops situated, the one in the High
Road, the other at Baldwin’s Hill, Loughton.  From inquiries by Mr. Bell,
inspector of nuisances, it would appear that of many shops in Loughton
selling violet powder, these two, and these only, obtained such powder
from a certain dealer in the East of London referred to by name by the
medical officer of health in his statement already mentioned.  Mr. Bell
further ascertained that in Loughton this particular powder was sold by
the retail tradesmen in small penny packets or boxes each of which bore
the name and address of the wholesale dealer in question.  The facts of
the connexion between the powder thus sold in Loughton and the prevalence
of disease are as follows:—

1.  Of the 29 sufferers, 27 had the particular powder in use at or about
the date of attack.  Of the remaining two, the mother of one had the
particular powder in the house at the time the infant was attacked, but
did not, so far as she can remember, use it; the other mother (whose
infant suffered very slightly) had no powder at all, and is of opinion
that the soreness of her infant’s neck was the result of pressure from
the instruments used in delivery.

2.  The sufferers with few exceptions (all of whom however had the
powder) were grouped near to one or other of the two shops which alone in
this extensive parish sold the particular powder in question.

3.  Infants using the particular powder, and those alone, were attacked
by the malady.  This is shown in the following table, which is an
abstract of the results of personal inquiry to this end respecting
infants born in the parish during the half year ended March 1878.  Except
where otherwise stated, violet powder of some sort was used to every
child, and (with certain exceptions to be considered in the text) only
one kind of powder was in use to the several children attacked by the
malady.

4.  Further and detailed evidence confirmatory in a high degree of
relation in the sense of effect to cause between the malady of infants
and the use of the particular powder, could, were it necessary, be given
in regard of most, if not all, of the cases attacked by the disease.  But
the following will suffice.  They are also explanatory of the interval
between birth and attack observed in certain cases recorded in the above
and in the previous table.

E. W., born 6th October 1877; attacked 25th October.  Mother states that
for the first fortnight from birth she used for dusting the infant violet
powder purchased at a distance.  This being expended, she obtained a
packet of the particular powder from one of the two shops in the parish
selling it.  A day or two after using this fresh powder she noticed
redness, blackness, and swelling of the privates and neck of the infant;
in three more days it died.  C. N., born 7th November 1877; attacked 31st
December.  Mother from infant’s birth used for dusting it violet powder
from a chemist near at home, and perhaps some also from a friend.  On
29th December she attended her daughter in confinement and took with her
her own infant.  Here she used for both infants powder from one of the
two shops referred to.  On 30th December her daughter’s, and on 31st
December her own, infant was attacked.  Daughter’s infant died January
1st; her own recovered, but is much scarred.  P. S., born 30th December;
attacked February 14.  From birth until about February 11th the mother
used violet powder remaining in the house since her last confinement; she
also used starch.  About the last-mentioned date she obtained some of the
particular powder, and after using it perhaps three days noticed pimples
on the groins, under the scrotum, under the arms, and at both sides of
the neck.  The pimples soon turned black, and became deep holes
discharging much yellow matter.  Used the powder a few days only; “did
not like it;” “it was yellow;” burned it.  Child recovered.  E. D., born
2nd January; attacked about 20th February.  The mother used starch powder
from infant’s birth until two days before it fell ill, when, having no
starch powder, she procured a packet of the particular violet powder.
This was used two days only, but the infant suffered in the same way as
P. S.  It recovered, but is scarred.  H. J., born 19th February 1878;
attacked middle March.  The mother at and after infant’s birth used
violet powder received as a present from London.  The day before the
infant was attacked she commenced using some of the particular powder
recently purchased.  The groins only were affected in this case; they
became black and broke into sores.  The use of the powder was
discontinued as soon as the infant fell ill.  On one occasion, however,
it was used to a sister aged two years and four months; she suffered in
like manner.  Both children recovered.  A. W., born 26th May 1877;
attacked 9th June.  The mother states that until the infant was 11 days
old she had no powder at all.  About 5th June she purchased a packet of
the particular powder and used it to the infant in the ordinary way.  On
9th June she noticed that the privates were swelled, and that white
bladders as big as a hazel nut had formed thereon, as well as under the
arms and around the neck.  These changed colour and broke into deep
wounds which discharged yellow matter.  Cores came out from the sores
under the arms.  The use of the powder was discontinued after six days,
and in about two months the infant was fairly well.  Hereupon the mother
recommenced the use of the particular powder, and the same night the
infant was very restless and screamed a great deal.  Next morning “the
bladders were out again;” the powder was then burned.  The child
eventually recovered, but is deeply scarred about the scrotum, groins,
neck, and armpits, as if by sloughing of the soft parts hereabouts.  F.
W., born 20th February 1877; attacked early in March.  From birth the
mother used violet powder from a chemist near at hand, but when the
infant was about a fortnight old she bought, and used to the lower parts
of its body only, a packet of the particular powder.  Next day the infant
broke out into sores about the navel and pudenda.  The use of the
particular powder was at once discontinued and the infant shortly got
well.  Some months later the mother being out of violet powder, again
used the particular powder to the infant, and at once the sores
reappeared.  The powder was then burned.  A. D., aged three years, was
attacked about Christmas 1877 by varicella.  During recovery and while
the pocks were dying away, she herself purchased a packet of the
particular powder, which was then used for dusting the eruption about the
pudenda.  Almost at once the dying vesicles became sores which turned
black and discharged matter; on healing they left scars.  It is stated
that in this instance the powder was used on one occasion only.  T. C.,
born 15th August 1877.  36 hours after birth pimples and bladders formed
about the privates and navel, which parts swelled, turned black, and
became hard; no sores.  Infant died 21st August.  The particular powder
was used in this instance from birth.  Three months afterwards some of
the remainder of this powder was used for dusting sores on the head,
face, and arms of a sister aged four years who had recently suffered from
measles.  These sores became much worse and inflamed; those on the arms
have left large scars.

Incidentally it is here shown that those parts only of infants bodies to
which toilet powder is ordinarily applied have been affected by the
malady; and further that such application of the particular powder has
been constantly followed in very few days by the symptoms complained of.
Additional evidence respecting the shortness of the interval between
application of the particular powder and the appearance of the symptoms
attributed to it, is afforded by the fact of 16 infants to whom this
powder was applied from birth onwards no less than 10 were attacked in
from one to four days.  Nor is the conclusion, irresistible from the
foregoing evidence, in any way weakened by the six instances in which the
attack was not immediate; for there must have been a beginning to the
mischievous quality of the powder bought at the shops of the vendors of
the particular powder.  These six cases were at the very commencement of
the total series.  All of them, and they were of various ages, from two
to 20 weeks, fell ill at the same time, viz., early in March 1877.  And
though all of them it would appear had used more than one packet of
violet powder from one or other of the two shops in question between
birth and the commencement of illness, in more than one instance a fresh
packet of powder is remembered to have been procured a day or two before
attack.  So far from weakening, these exceptions strengthen the
conclusion; more than that, they seem to indicate that not until the end
of February or early March of last year did violet powder bought at these
two shops in Loughton possess hurtful properties.

Probably enough has been made out to satisfy any reasonable doubt that
may have been entertained as to the connexion between the use in Loughton
of the particular violet powder and the lamentable effects attributed to
it.  It will be observed that the evidence is absolutely independent of
the nature of the irritating agent in the powder.  Whether or not that
agent may have been arsenic, as found by Mr. Jones in the specimens
submitted to him by Mr. Deacon, matters nothing to the proof I have given
of this connexion.  But I have submitted to Dr. Dupré for analysis
samples of the violet powder which I obtained from the mothers of three
of the sufferers from the malady, and when Dr. Dupré’s report is received
I shall append it.  Meanwhile I annex a tabulated statement of the cases
investigated.

REPORT on three samples of VIOLET POWDER received from Mr. W. H. POWER,
April 4, 1878.


All the powders were of a very pale yellowish colour, and rather more
gritty to the touch than ordinary violet powder; they were also
appreciably heavier, bulk for bulk.  Taking the weight of a given bulk of
ordinary violet powder as 1, the same bulk of these powders would weigh
about 1.25.  Under the microscope they are shown to consist of potatoe
starch mixed with a very considerable proportion of crystalline matter,
among which regular octahedra (arsenious acid) can be distinguished.  On
burning they evolve a very powerful arsenical odour.

         Chemical analysis showed them to consist in 100 parts of

Creating the works from print editions not protected by U.S. copyright
law means that no one owns a United States copyright in these works,
so the Foundation (and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United
States without permission and without paying copyright
royalties. Special rules, set forth in the General Terms of Use part
of this license, apply to copying and distributing Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works to protect the PROJECT GUTENBERG-tm
concept and trademark. Project Gutenberg is a registered trademark,
and may not be used if you charge for the eBooks, unless you receive
specific permission. If you do not charge anything for copies of this
eBook, complying with the rules is very easy. You may use this eBook
for nearly any purpose such as creation of derivative works, reports,
performances and research. They may be modified and printed and given
away--you may do practically ANYTHING in the United States with eBooks
not protected by U.S. copyright law. Redistribution is subject to the
trademark license, especially commercial redistribution.

THE FULL PROJECT GUTENBERG LICENSE
PLEASE READ THIS BEFORE YOU DISTRIBUTE OR USE THIS WORK

To protect the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting the free
distribution of electronic works, by using or distributing this work
(or any other work associated in any way with the phrase "Project
Gutenberg"), you agree to comply with all the terms of the Full
Project Gutenberg-tm License available with this file or online at
www.gutenberg.org/license.

Section 1. General Terms of Use and Redistributing Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works

1.A. By reading or using any part of this Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work, you indicate that you have read, understand, agree to
and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property
(trademark/copyright) agreement. If you do not agree to abide by all
the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or
destroy all copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in your
possession. If you paid a fee for obtaining a copy of or access to a
Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work and you do not agree to be bound
by the terms of this agreement, you may obtain a refund from the
person or entity to whom you paid the fee as set forth in paragraph
1.E.8.

1.B. "Project Gutenberg" is a registered trademark. It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement. There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement. See
paragraph 1.C below. There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works if you follow the terms of this
agreement and help preserve free future access to Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works. See paragraph 1.E below.

1.C. The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation ("the
Foundation" or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection
of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works. Nearly all the individual
works in the collection are in the public domain in the United
States. If an individual work is unprotected by copyright law in the
United States and you are located in the United States, we do not
claim a right to prevent you from copying, distributing, performing,
displaying or creating derivative works based on the work as long as
all references to Project Gutenberg are removed. Of course, we hope
that you will support the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting
free access to electronic works by freely sharing Project Gutenberg-tm
works in compliance with the terms of this agreement for keeping the
Project Gutenberg-tm name associated with the work. You can easily
comply with the terms of this agreement by keeping this work in the
same format with its attached full Project Gutenberg-tm License when
you share it without charge with others.

1.D. The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work. Copyright laws in most countries are
in a constant state of change. If you are outside the United States,
check the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this
agreement before downloading, copying, displaying, performing,
distributing or creating derivative works based on this work or any
other Project Gutenberg-tm work. The Foundation makes no
representations concerning the copyright status of any work in any
country outside the United States.

1.E. Unless you have removed all references to Project Gutenberg:

1.E.1. The following sentence, with active links to, or other
immediate access to, the full Project Gutenberg-tm License must appear
prominently whenever any copy of a Project Gutenberg-tm work (any work
on which the phrase "Project Gutenberg" appears, or with which the
phrase "Project Gutenberg" is associated) is accessed, displayed,
performed, viewed, copied or distributed:

  This eBook is for the use of anyone anywhere in the United States and
  most other parts of the world at no cost and with almost no
  restrictions whatsoever. You may copy it, give it away or re-use it
  under the terms of the Project Gutenberg License included with this
  eBook or online at www.gutenberg.org. If you are not located in the
  United States, you'll have to check the laws of the country where you
  are located before using this ebook.

1.E.2. If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is
derived from texts not protected by U.S. copyright law (does not
contain a notice indicating that it is posted with permission of the
copyright holder), the work can be copied and distributed to anyone in
the United States without paying any fees or charges. If you are
redistributing or providing access to a work with the phrase "Project
Gutenberg" associated with or appearing on the work, you must comply
either with the requirements of paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 or
obtain permission for the use of the work and the Project Gutenberg-tm
trademark as set forth in paragraphs 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.

1.E.3. If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is posted
with the permission of the copyright holder, your use and distribution
must comply with both paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 and any
additional terms imposed by the copyright holder. Additional terms
will be linked to the Project Gutenberg-tm License for all works
posted with the permission of the copyright holder found at the
beginning of this work.

1.E.4. Do not unlink or detach or remove the full Project Gutenberg-tm
License terms from this work, or any files containing a part of this
work or any other work associated with Project Gutenberg-tm.

1.E.5. Do not copy, display, perform, distribute or redistribute this
electronic work, or any part of this electronic work, without
prominently displaying the sentence set forth in paragraph 1.E.1 with
active links or immediate access to the full terms of the Project
Gutenberg-tm License.

1.E.6. You may convert to and distribute this work in any binary,
compressed, marked up, nonproprietary or proprietary form, including
any word processing or hypertext form. However, if you provide access
to or distribute copies of a Project Gutenberg-tm work in a format
other than "Plain Vanilla ASCII" or other format used in the official
version posted on the official Project Gutenberg-tm web site
(www.gutenberg.org), you must, at no additional cost, fee or expense
to the user, provide a copy, a means of exporting a copy, or a means
of obtaining a copy upon request, of the work in its original "Plain
Vanilla ASCII" or other form. Any alternate format must include the
full Project Gutenberg-tm License as specified in paragraph 1.E.1.

1.E.7. Do not charge a fee for access to, viewing, displaying,
performing, copying or distributing any Project Gutenberg-tm works
unless you comply with paragraph 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.

1.E.8. You may charge a reasonable fee for copies of or providing
access to or distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
provided that

* You pay a royalty fee of 20% of the gross profits you derive from
  the use of Project Gutenberg-tm works calculated using the method
  you already use to calculate your applicable taxes. The fee is owed
  to the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark, but he has
  agreed to donate royalties under this paragraph to the Project
  Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation. Royalty payments must be paid
  within 60 days following each date on which you prepare (or are
  legally required to prepare) your periodic tax returns. Royalty
  payments should be clearly marked as such and sent to the Project
  Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation at the address specified in
  Section 4, "Information about donations to the Project Gutenberg
  Literary Archive Foundation."

* You provide a full refund of any money paid by a user who notifies
  you in writing (or by e-mail) within 30 days of receipt that s/he
  does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg-tm
  License. You must require such a user to return or destroy all
  copies of the works possessed in a physical medium and discontinue
  all use of and all access to other copies of Project Gutenberg-tm
  works.

* You provide, in accordance with paragraph 1.F.3, a full refund of
  any money paid for a work or a replacement copy, if a defect in the
  electronic work is discovered and reported to you within 90 days of
  receipt of the work.

* You comply with all other terms of this agreement for free
  distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm works.

1.E.9. If you wish to charge a fee or distribute a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work or group of works on different terms than
are set forth in this agreement, you must obtain permission in writing
from both the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation and The
Project Gutenberg Trademark LLC, the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm
trademark. Contact the Foundation as set forth in Section 3 below.

1.F.

1.F.1. Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
works not protected by U.S. copyright law in creating the Project
Gutenberg-tm collection. Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may
contain "Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate
or corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other
intellectual property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or
other medium, a computer virus, or computer codes that damage or
cannot be read by your equipment.

1.F.2. LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees. YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH 1.F.3. YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.

1.F.3. LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from. If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium
with your written explanation. The person or entity that provided you
with the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in
lieu of a refund. If you received the work electronically, the person
or entity providing it to you may choose to give you a second
opportunity to receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund. If
the second copy is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing
without further opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4. Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS', WITH NO
OTHER WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT
LIMITED TO WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY OR FITNESS FOR ANY PURPOSE.

1.F.5. Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied
warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of
damages. If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement
violates the law of the state applicable to this agreement, the
agreement shall be interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or
limitation permitted by the applicable state law. The invalidity or
unenforceability of any provision of this agreement shall not void the
remaining provisions.

1.F.6. INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in
accordance with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the
production, promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works, harmless from all liability, costs and expenses,
including legal fees, that arise directly or indirectly from any of
the following which you do or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this
or any Project Gutenberg-tm work, (b) alteration, modification, or
additions or deletions to any Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any
Defect you cause.

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at
www.gutenberg.org 

Section 3. Information about the Project Gutenberg Literary 
Archive Foundation

501(c)(3) educational corporation organized under the laws of the
state of Mississippi and granted tax exempt status by the Internal
Revenue Service. The Foundation's EIN or federal tax identification

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular
state visit www.gutenberg.org/donate

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works.

Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg-tm concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search
facility: www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
